Using python skills and pandas, matplotlib and much more to increase my ability to help omar with this assignment. We created a dataframe using jupiter to combine two CVS files to ganerate results instead of using different to look for the data, we could simply align the two file data together in all together.

Rural cities had the lowest number of rides and drivers

Suburban cities is second place in rides and number of drivers 

Rural cities had the least amount of drivers but the highest average of fare per ride 

Urban cities had more drivers and the lowestaverage of  fare per ride and driver average fare 

Challenges: 
 Between the months of January and April all the cities and urban cities had the highest fare per week and increasing demand.
